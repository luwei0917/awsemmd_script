   *************** updating history ********************************
   2012/01/24: A C/C++ code of TM-align was constructed by Jianyi Yang
   2016/05/21: Several updates of this program were made by Jianjie Wu, including
              (1) fixed several compiling bugs
	      (2) made I/O of C/C++ version consistent with the Fortran version
	      (3) added outputs including full-atom and ligand structures
	      (4) added options of '-i', '-I' and '-m'
